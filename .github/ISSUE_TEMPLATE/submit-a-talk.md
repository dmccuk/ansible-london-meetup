- Why did i create this?
Well, I've always been told that if you have to do something twice, you should automate it. I write a lot of ansible and it just seems odd that we don't have a way to automate this process. This is my attempt to create a working ansible base that includes all the most common requirements that can be edited after creation. All the formatting and syntax is correct and there are lots of examples for people to build on. This is my go at automating the writing of ansible. I have many idea's to expand the capabilities.
